Welcome to The Full Guide to The Natty Sweet Spot.
This is not going to be your typical muscle and body fat article.
Side note: This one took some time to put together, but I wanted to make it a banger as a token of appreciation for my absence.
So this is going to be everything I wish I knew 5-10 years ago about the mind, body and soul — when I first got into lifting and self-improvement.
We'll be covering everything from the body, to your health, to your inner purpose for being here.
Let's get into it:
So flashback to July 2023.
I was living in Thailand.
Sun. Freedom. Beaches.

Asian dishes for the price of a diet coke.
Asian bishes everywhere I looked.
But I wasn't indulging.
I was focused on getting as shredded as possible.
This cut had been going on for several months, and I was at the backend trying to get lean for a photoshoot.
Most days I struggled to focus, or keep my eyes open at all.
I was in my 9th year of training at this point, and looked pretty good:

But secretly I felt fucking awful.
No energy
No sex drive
No passion for my work
Training wasn't enjoyable, I didn't even want to speak to people.
Training wasn't even enjoyable (that's when I knew it was bad)...
But that's what extreme diets do to you.
No energy for anything, anyone, I didn't even wanna speak to people.
It just felt like I was doing it all for nothing.
Guy in his 20s in Thailand, jacked, traveling, partying,
Living the dream right?!
But the reality was I felt horrendous.
It was like being a priest with a massive shlong.
Wasted.
But this had always been a goal of mine:
Finally get down to the holy grail of bodybuilding - 'single digit body fat':
Stroll down the beach, getting clocked from the ladies, and scaring the locals.
But they lied.
They told us getting diced (super lean), would make us feel incredible:
Insane energy
Nutty veins
Look constantly jacked
Streamlined jaw
Attracting countless worldies
Looking and feeling your greatest form possible
But it was the opposite.
No one told me how shit it would feel to be here.
And the worst part is you form an identity of being the 'shredded guy', and it starts fucking with your head.
I had around 2 weeks to go before the photoshoot.
Still had around 4Ibs to drop to get to single digits.
If I could just grind it out, I'd look great and have all these photos for my business.
But I said FUCK this..
and abandoned the photoshoot.
Ruining myself and my hormones, all for some validation from people online?
And I didn't even believe in getting ultra shredded.. I just thought it was what 'you're supposed to do'.
I don't have those photoshoot photos, in arguably the 'best condition' of my life.
Energy, hormones, happiness and health are my staples I don't sacrifice for anything.
I could've landed some new clients who only bought cos they wanted to look like that too.
But I don't stand for that.
All these guys you see looking peeled on Instagram are miserable inside.
And I learned my lesson the hard way:
Being shredded isn't what it looks like.
now let's dive into The Natty Sweet Spot and how to actually get lean and looking good the right way:
The expectations:
People staring.
Guys in disbelief.
(Their girl also in disbelief)
JACKED, SHREDDED PHENOM IS HERE

And I won't sugar-coat.
The feeling is nice.
But it doesn't reflect what you feel on the inside.
I want you to ask yourself if months (if not years of feeling trash every day):

Is worth that 1 moment of validation?
For me, I quickly found out the answer was a resounding fuck no.
So is it that simple? Just don't get super shredded??
Well, yes.. and no.
But here's the thing..
You can feel awful at a variety of ranges.
I'm sure you've felt shitty for weeks, months, even years - all while not being close to shredded.
If we're being real, you walk round 30-40lbs heavier than your '6 pack shredded' weight (and that isn't counting the peaks during the holidays).
This is the other side of The Natty Sweet Spot.
But for me, this didn't mean '30 lbs overweight'.
I was decently jacked, lean, and from the outside I looked healthy:

Marley, circa mid-2022
Body fat wise, not far off where I wanted to be.
But I had no confidence, anxiety through the roof.
Feeling shitty every day — just like when I was shredded.
It made no sense to me.
So I got to researching.
Hormones, nutrition, muscle mass, sunlight, sleep.
This was my arc of going from:
Bodybuilder Bro -> Health-focussed, Energy- maxxed, Jacked Sober Commander General.
I'd been suffering low T symptoms most of my life.
Anxiety was always a big problem, having low confidence, feeling inferior and not wanting to speak up.
So this wasn't new to me.
But I knew something hadn't been right for a long time.
So I got myself checked.
But here's the more interesting part:
1 year prior I'd gone through this exact same situation - only looking and feeling worse.
Here's me in late 2021:

Eating shit, drinking every night, not sleeping.
And here, the symptoms make sense.
But get this..
I have my testosterone results from both times...
And the results might shock you..

Top: 2021, fat — Bottom: 2022, lean
The Results (converted to US units):

October 2021
B12: 21.5 pg/ml (Low)
Vitamin D: 23.2 ng/dl (Extremely low)
Testosterone: 429 ng/dl (Low normal)
October 2022
B12: 39 pg/ml (High)
Vitamin D: 71.6 ngl/dl (High)
Testosterone: 346 ng/dl (Clinically low)
A year of trying to raise my testosterone.. and it dropped almost 20%.
In some ways, it was nice.
All the symptoms confirmed - it was like knowing you were right about your missus cheating all along..
But I knew something wasn't right.
I spend the next several months researching for hours every night, on hormones, health, nutrition, diet, everything they don't tell us about..
And that's how I accidentally formed 'The Natty Sweet Spot':

When you reach this point, everything just feels... in line.
You look great, feel great, and operate on a completely different level.
But here's what most guys forget:

'Attraction', 'presence', 'aura'.. these aren't just 'visual' or aesthetic;
You show them from the inside – from your frequency of operation.
(I know it sounds woo-woo but hear me out)..
Your aura is 'felt'.
It's the energy you give. The vibe people get.
When someone's vibrating on a high frequency, you get 'good vibes'... and visa versa on a low frequency, you won't.
You could be the most jacked, Chad alive - but if your vibe and energy are off, you're as good as a stick.
When you sacrifice The Natty Sweet Spot for aesthetics, your frequency drops.
But a humble homosapien like yourself must feel good to operate well, attract energy, positivity, opportunities and happiness.
"The energy you put out is the energy you receive"
(Einstein, probably)
So how do you reach The Natty Sweet Spot?
As the diagram shows, there are 7 core ideas:
• Body
• Hormones
• Health
• Peace
• Energy
• Mental health
• Happiness
Each can be defined by a range.
Any focus one singular asset too far, and you will deviate from the sweet spot.
The body works holistically, and synchronously.
To operate at your highest frequency, you must have an equal split across these.

(This doesn't mean you can't focus 1 in the short-term, and you should do this on the come up)
But to reach your ultimate form, you will always come back to the centre circle:

Once you align to this, you will no longer feel the need for external supplementation.
The need to outsource any one of these is because of neglect.
Video games, bad food, drugs and alcohol, they are all bandaid solutions for veering from The Natty Sweet Spot.
But reach this and you reach your true natural flow.
So let's break down exactly what these 'ideas' are, and where the happy medium is for each one:
Body / physique

Let's start with the big one.

Your body works in ways more complicated that you, I or the wizardest minds could ever explain.

But the core of what we care about is still the aesthetic.

So for this area, we are focusing mostly on body composition.

In a nutshell, body composition is how jacked you look (muscle) and how shredded you look (leanness).

The best place to sit is somewhere where you can see abs, look great, slick, chiseled face, healthy glowing skin, and high muscle mass.

But only to a point you don't sacrifice everything else wanting to end it daily just to maintain super shredded territory.

I've trialed many physiques over the years, and this is my ballpark conclusion:

Bodyfat: between 11% to 15%
Anything under 11% is too low. Anything above 14% — you start looking anaesthetically maxxed.

Muscle mass: it depends..

I wrote this post last month, showing some good ballpark weights for men at 10%:

But these are at the bottom end of being shredded (9-10%).
Hopefully you know by now, the 'men should be 200lbs' thing is a load of shit, all in cope from fat powerlifters bros who never take their top off.
A good basis to use is 2.4-2.5lbs LBM (Lean body mass) per inch of height.
Here's adjusted ranges for height/weight ratio at The Natty Sweet Spot:
5'7" → 155 lbs (2.38 lb/in)
5'8" → 160 lbs (2.41 lb/in)
5'9" → 165 lbs (2.43 lb/in)
5'10" → 170 lbs (2.46 lb/in)
5'11" → 175 lbs (2.49 lb/in)
6'0" → 180 lbs (2.50 lb/in)
6'1" → 185 lbs (2.52 lb/in)
6'2" → 190 lbs (2.55 lb/in)
6'3" → 195 lbs (2.56 lb/in)
(Note: these are based on average 12% BF, and may swing ±5lbs).
So these are the goal body-weights, but how do you know if you're in The Natty Sweet Spot?
The main driver is muscle mass.
If you started from minimal muscle mass, I like people to go for a +30% LBM increase.
Take myself as example, I started 119lbs at ~11% BF. I now sit at 161lbs at ~12% BF. This is a roughly 34% LBM increase.
Here's what this looks like visually:

Left: 2014 untrained — Right: 2023, training 9 years
Of course not everyone starts as a fucking pencil like I was, but there you can still add a lot of muscle mass.
Here's what that looks like for different genetics:

No, it's not the '+60lbs in 2 years!' kind of shit. But with good genetics, you can increase your LBM by 20%, 30%, and in some rare cases even over 40%.
So the body sweet spot will be in that 11-14% range, at roughly 2.4lbs of LBM / inch of height, and ideally 20-40% increase in LBM from your starting point.
Hormones

Your hormones are your quality of life.
Everything from how you feel, how your body works, your mind state, your energy, your muscle building ability, even your hair.
As a natural athlete, I like to sit somewhere around the 600-800 ngl/dl mark. In normal-terms, this is what you could just above-average.
The average 100 years ago was almost 1000. It's now under 500.
It's mind-blowing.
This is why we must focus on our hormone profile heavily, as it influences just about every other part of you.
But hormones aren't just the total testosterone number.
I won't go into everything today, but there are many things we need to monitor and focus on to have optimal hormones.
Here are some hormone levels I typically like to see:
Free Testosterone: ~2.5%
Cortisol (stress): ~10–15 µg/dL (low) between 6-9am
Serum Vitamin D: ~40-60ng/mL (high)
Oestrogen (E2): ~20-30 pg/mL (average)
Health

You've probably heard the saying 'health is wealth'.
But the more you think about it, the more weight it holds.
We do everything in life at the expectation of getting to our later years healthy, safe and stress-free.
So why do we do everything BUT the things that bring us this?
Health to me is the core of life.
Without it, nothing is worth having.
The body, mind, soul, can't function without health.
So here's some questions I want you to ponder:
When there's 'more work' to do — are you getting out for a walk in the sun?
Are you monitoring the foods you're putting in your body?
Getting 7-9 hours sleep every night?
Prioritising minerals that look after your bone health, joints, skin, and cells?
Are you avoiding alcohol?
When was the last time you did high intensity (HIIT) cardio?
Do you know how your RHR, HRV, VO₂max affect your heart?
It may feel like I'm hammering this point, but I want you to truly consider if you're prioritising your health right now.
We're living in a world of depressed billionaires, jacked bodybuilders on their deathbed, and workaholics having strokes, cancers and all sorts of nasty stuff.
The common denominator between them?
Not prioritising health.
This is one thing I always have to pull myself back in line with, even as a health professional.
Peace

Peace. Peace is bliss. Peace is calm.
Peace is the feeling you get when there is nothing left to add, and you're completely and content with everything the way it is.
But most of us will never experience true peace.
Why?
Because to be at peace, is to be at complete contentment.
No growth. No mission. No desire.
We are goal-striving humans, and peace is the anti-dote of accomplishment.
But you can be okay with it.
Because peace doesn't need to come from every area of your life.
You can be at peace in one area, and in intense drive in another.
— Finishing a day's work to come back to your partner or family is a form of peace.

— Building your elite body and looking back in the mirror is a form of peace.

— Being a good person and giving as much as you can for others is a form of peace.
It comes in all kinds of forms.
But just because you may not reach true peace, it doesn't mean you shouldn't strive for it.
Meditation, breathing techniques, time at rest are all forms of peace, both short-term and long-term.
The Stoics
The Stoics were ancient philosophers who believed in finding peace in all situations.
They didn’t chase pleasure. They didn’t complain when things went wrong.
They aimed to live with virtue, discipline, and reason.
It's almost impossible to become 100% 'Stoic' in 2025.
but harnessing as much of this energy as possible has been incredibly useful for me in the past few years.
Just remember this:
"Nothing's worth fucking over your peace for in the long term".
— Marley McBride, 2025
Energy

Energy.
This is one of those words that's thrown around a lot.
But energy is the life source of all what is well and good.
And at the end of it, restoring energy is the 80% of my mission here.
Why?
Because we as humans ARE energy.
Not just physical energy (like riding a bike), but the energies we connect with.
We devour it. We transmute it. We exchange it with people, tasks and missions.
It's the energy inside, deep in your bones, cells, even down to your soul.
Westerners are living like vampires: soulless.
I can't count the number of people I observe in London braindead on the tube, looking like they've lost all life-force.
Without feeling fueled with vigor, drive and passion, I see no point in existence.
So how do you get more 'energy'?
Well, back in the 50s and 60s, we were coming out of a brutal stretch.
World wars, recessions, famine;
The people were craving energy — physically, mentally, spiritually.
It didn't matter how, they just needed something — and FAST.
But that's where it turned.
Introducing the mass adoption of:
Caffeine.
Caffeine wasn't adopted til the 50s and 60s.
Meaning we're only the second generation in existence to use caffeine.
But now, we've become completely reliant.
I found this crazy when I realized how recent it was.
And it's never been easier to earn your way with the western comforts of the modern world.
BUT — we have less energy than ever.
The things we were 'told' give us energy like coffee, burgers, all these supplements — they are actually working against your real energy.
This is what I found, when a year ago I was ultra 'dialled in' with all these stacks and supplements, and smashing 10 cups of caffeine per day.
But I was rundown, anxious and falling asleep at 10am.I hit a burnout. Bad.
Long story short, I quit caffeine, gave up all the supplements, and dialed in my nutrition and everything else in this guide.
This is the essence of what I call 'Limitless Flow' (I have a full in-depth guide coming on this soon, look out for it).
And a few days ago past over 365 days caffeine-free.
I would've called you crazy 12 months ago, but I've never felt so much real energy and drive every hour of the day.
(I'll go into caffeine in a full guide soon — but I've realized just how much it destroys our energy — whilst leaving us hooked, reliant and believing it's good for us.)
To bring this back, our energy comes from everything we do. Every decision. Whether we scroll in a morning or go outside. What we drink and eat. The influences from the outside we let in.
Energy is sacred, and the more you can source from within (and limit as much externally as possible), the sooner you'll feel your energy come back.
Mental health

Now, mental health is always.. assumed.
And everyone always tells you the things to DO:
- 'speak to people'
- 'listen to uplifting music'
- 'eat better foods'
But good mental health comes from doing less — the what NOT to do.
Your mental health comes from removing things from your sensory cabinet.
Poor mental health comes from overload; lack of clarity to think, focus and make decisions.
Because think about people in the darkest times —
Marcus Aurelius, not just survived but thrived in war, plague, betrayal.
Viktor Frankl, locked in concentration camps for 3 years. Starved, beaten, no family.
Even good old Abe Lincoln, freeing the enslaved Southerners and steering the civil wars.
They had more 'stress' on their plate than we will ever experience, yet they stayed mental dynamite.
So how did they do it?
They limited everything that brought uncertainty, disruption or entropy to the mind.
The mind is stronger, and the fortitude possible is greater than we could ever imagine.
(if you haven't, read Frankl's 'A Man's Search For Meaning')
I won't go into everything today, but here's what I've seen as the bigger mental health destroyers:
Alcohol
The news
Social media
Drugs and pot
Constant over-stimulation
Never-ending work (Oliver Burkeman's '4000 hours' is an incredible read on this)
Messy environments
Isolation and lack of connection
The goal should be to slow down. Talk to friends in nature. Eat your meals in silence. Go to a cabin with someone and shut off for a few days.
And stop looking to comfort yourself in alcohol.
But as the song goes:
'The drugs don't work, they just make you worse.'
Happiness

The way to happiness is lack of anxiety.
And anxiety is the opposite of confidence.
So the way to happiness, is to have confidence, assuredness, and lack-of-scarcity in all areas of life.
(at least that's the goal)..
The difference between peace and happiness is happiness is ongoing, peace is at a a place of rest; the finish line.
Happiness is joy, no matter the journey.
Happiness is what we all need more in our lives. You can be dissatisfied, but happy.
Because everyone — whether you're born into poverty, royalty or you're Musk's son — has a journey of growth, decisions and tribulations in life.
Some moments will be incredible; some brutal.
But if you can accept this journey is happening regardless, you can literally decide to be happy.
I'm still working on this, and it's my biggest lagging area of The Natty Sweet Spot.
Because we always say 'once I get X', 'once I achieve Y', THEN I'll be happy.
But the goal posts never stop moving.
After making several leaps in my life so far, I've still yet to become any more happy.
So it makes sense to be happy now, rather than at some magical end point;
because if you can't be happy with nothing, you won't be happy with something.
So here are some closing thoughts on becoming happier, despite having a way to go in your path:
Choose long-term gratification.

The feeling of happiness is looking back at the recent-to-mid term past, and being satisfied with your efforts.

When you choose short-term pleasures (like drinking, video games, and too much chilling), you never look back in self-pride.

Always choose the hard thing now, or the happiness is what you will surrender.
Find happiness in the small shit.

Ultimate happiness may never come. I'm ambitious AF. You probably are too. And we won't achieve everything.

But that's fine. We can find happiness in the little things in life. A great book for this is 'The Power of Now'.

These are the golden days. Here. Now. Today.
The work IS the goal.

Having purpose, mission, direction - you are doing what you love (whether it's working yet or not).

And THAT is a reason in itself to be happy and kind to yourself.
Give yourself some leeway.

With the pursuit of happiness, we want to be perfect. Whether it's getting that physique. Getting the girl. Building the business / career.

But you don't need to be 100% perfect. We aren't robots. We are humans. And humans are far from perfect.

Have the pizza once a month. Stay out late. Take the Monday off work.

Happiness is striking the subtle balance of self-autonomy and self-care.
Ultimately, do what makes you happy.

Don't let any person, society or narrative dictate the direction and choices of your life.

You have 1 life. 1 chance. Never stop doing what makes you happy.
That's everything I have for you today.

I hope this has given you a new direction to lead towards.
The Natty Sweet Spot is about a true holistic sweet spot of being — a complete body, health, mind and soul state.
This is everything I've built over the past decade, yet it feels like I'm only just getting started.
And it's why I've created Limitless.
If you're interested in seeing how I can help you reach your ultimate male form, and live at your peak state every day (i.e. your Natty Sweet Spot)
I'm selecting a few early adopters for this brand new system to:
cure your chronic tiredness
gain 28 hours of energy a week
quit alcohol and caffeine for good
And this doesn't require starving yourself on chicken salads. Using willpower. Or even spending longer than 2 days a week in the gym.
