## DRAFT - What Happens If You Don't Fix This

But here's the thing I need you to understand.

Without energy, you have nothing.

Without energy, your relationships suffer.
Your work and business will drop.
Your body will deteriorate.

And you will KEEP on waking up feeling like this, until you change your system.

I stumbled on a Harvard Medical Study that changed my mind on everything.

The researchers found men with declining testosterone have up to 50% higher chance of early death.

Now I won't lie — this scared the shit out of me.

A 40-year-old man today has the same testosterone as an 80-year-old from 50 years ago.

And what's more worrying to me is the effect this has on successful men like you.

When you look in the mirror, do you see the man you thought you'd become?

You know, when you were 25, full of life, energy, drive...

Did you picture yourself needing coffee after coffee just to get through the day?

Did you imagine needing a drink every night just to get out of your own head?

Let me put it like this.

When you get to the end of your life, what do you hope to achieve?

What kind of legacy do you want to leave?

Because sure, the money, the status, the success — that's all great.

But if you feel like shit every day, what's the point?

Think about it like this.

If you owned a million-pound racehorse that could secure your family's future and change your life...

Would you just pump it full of stimulants and substances that deteriorate it?

Or would you give it the best nutrition, the best recovery, the best trainers?

Well, you ARE that racehorse.

But right now, you're running yourself into the ground.
