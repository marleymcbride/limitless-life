        Three Years Ago I Was Blackout Drunk On A Mud-Stained Mattress

    Do you ever wake up feeling like complete shit?


    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    I know the feeling.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I had the Masters degree on the wall, hitting the gym, earning decent money.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      People would say I &apos;had my shit together&apos;...
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      But the truth?
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">

    </p>

    <p className="mini-heading text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    My life was hell.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
     Falling asleep at my desk at 10am.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-0">
    Drinking every night.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
    And a gut hanging over my trousers.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      On top of this I was stressed out, anxious, and unhappy with my life.


    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 font-bold leading-relaxed mb-6">
      What did I do?
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Blamed it on everyone else of course!
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I blamed my job... quit engineering and became a Personal Trainer.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I blamed my genetics... and started buying all these supplements I saw online.
