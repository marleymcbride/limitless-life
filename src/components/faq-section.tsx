      question: "How much time will this take each week?",
      answer:
        "The program is specifically designed for busy executives. You'll need about 3-4 hours per week for exercise, 30 minutes for weekly coaching, and about 15 minutes daily for tracking and habits. We focus on efficiency and results, not time-consuming activities.",
    },
    {
      question: "I've tried other programs before. How is this different?",
      answer:
        "Most programs focus on just one aspectâ€”diet, exercise, or mindset. The Limitless Method addresses all four critical systems simultaneously: metabolic, physiological, cognitive, and behavioral. This integrated approach is why our clients see results when other programs have failed them.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need special equipment or a gym membership?",
      answer:
        "No. The exercise protocols can be done with minimal equipment at home or in a hotel room. If you have gym access, we'll incorporate that, but it's not required. We design everything to fit your lifestyle and available resources.",
    },
    {
      question: "I travel frequently for work. Will this still work for me?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. The program is specifically designed for executives who travel. We provide travel protocols, restaurant guides, and strategies for maintaining progress no matter where you are in the world.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly will I see results?",
      answer:
        "Most clients report significant energy improvements within the first 7-10 days. Visible physical changes typically begin around week 3-4, with major transformations by week 8-12. The exact timeline depends on your starting point and consistency.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will this work with my medical condition?",
      answer:
        "We've worked successfully with clients managing various health conditions including high blood pressure, pre-diabetes, and thyroid issues. During our initial assessment, we'll review your medical history to ensure our approach is appropriate for your specific situation. In some cases, we may suggest working with your physician for monitoring as you progress.",
