            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Back in October 2021, my life looked great.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I was earning decent money. Building up a client base. Had a good dating and social life.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              And felt like I&apos;d got the respect of my family and friends.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Masters degree on the wall, offers from engineering companies to work in the big city, built a good physique.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            A decade sacrificing everything.. just so people would think I had my shit together.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But the truth is… I felt miserable.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Every day felt like I was dragging myself through. Feeling stressed, anxious, insecure, and low energy.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I&apos;d need coffee after coffee to survive the day.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The first thing I did was immediately blame it on the career.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I decided the corporate life wasn&apos;t for me, and followed my passion in health and fitness
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              And Personal Training at a luxury health club.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For the next few months, things improved.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The new job, new environment, new people… it seemed like everything should be better.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But the problem was:
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I still felt like shit.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Every morning I&apos;d wake up and have complete lack of energy.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Simple everyday tasks like getting out of bed, getting ready, taking the dog for a walk — felt like a mountain.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              And look - I thought maybe I was just &apos;low energy&apos;.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But it was affecting my entire life.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              How I performed at work. How I was with my girlfriend. Even how I felt about myself.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              My energy was shot.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I&apos;d wake up almost every day feeling like someone had smashed me with a baseball bat.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              And when I looked in the mirror I barely recognized myself.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Bags under my eyes.
              Bit of a gut forming.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This wasn&apos;t how I pictured myself.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              And over time my coffee use went from 3 drinks, to 4, to 5, to energy drinks, and then I found myself taking caffeine tablets.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But my energy never got any better.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              On top of this, my head was all over the place.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Wondering if I&apos;d have next month&apos;s rent covered, the worries of tax and inflation, constant stress from work, all the usual shit.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I had severed brain fog.
              I was falling asleep at my desk at 10am.
              And my stress and anxiety wouldn&apos;t go.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I tried everything. Keto diet.Keto. Intermittent fasting. Training 5+ days a week. I even tried the testosterone boosters.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But nothing worked.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Day by day I was getting worn down.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              So I turned to the only stress relief I knew.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Booze.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I&apos;d been drinking since 13. It all started because I wasn&apos;t confident in myself. But by my early 20s, I couldn&apos;t function without it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            And I couldn&apos;t get out of it. Every weekend I&apos;d promise myself I wouldn&apos;t drink. Every Friday I&apos;d fail.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But the worst thing about this?
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              No one had a clue.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I put on a fake smile.
              Hid my drinking from everyone.
              And told myself this was just normal.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But on Halloween everything changed.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I went on a night out for a work party, and got blackout drunk.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I don&apos;t remember exactly what happened, but I remember being obnoxiously drunk.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The morning after in I woke up mortified.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Now - a detail I forgot to mention is I was living in a tiny spare room at my friend&apos;s house on a mattress on the floor.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The mattress was covered in mud, as were my jeans I still had on.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              No fucking idea how I got home!
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But this was just the start…
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I checked my phone, and saw 15 missed calls.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I&apos;d slept in til 2pm and missed my whole day&apos;s clients.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Looking round the box room, staring at my phone, thinking my life couldn&apos;t get any lower.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I woke up exhausted every morning, my sex drive non-existent, a gut that wouldn&apos;t budge, and I felt so stressed and anxious whilst feeling completely dependant on caffeine and alcohol.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I couldn&apos;t keep going.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Through the next year or so I devoted my life to fixing myself.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But the fucked thing was the problem wasn&apos;t effort.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              See - I was already training five to six times a week, eating the &apos;gym meals&apos;, and staying disciplined.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              I started to question if I had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              So I got a testosterone test.
