            You can be successful on paper, but if you wake up feeling stressed, drag yourself through the day,
            and need substances just to function - you&apos;re living a lie. The gap between your external success
            and internal reality is eating you alive.

              The Limitless Life: Waking Up With Natural Energy
            </h3>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Imagine waking up before your alarm feeling energized. Going through your day with sustained
              focus and clarity. Being present with your family instead of mentally checked out. Feeling proud
              of your body instead of ashamed of it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              This isn&apos;t a fantasy. This is what happens when you stop fighting your body and start working
              with its natural intelligence. Energy becomes the foundation that transforms your business,
              your relationships, and your entire life.

                You look successful to everyone else, but inside you feel like a fraud. You&apos;re pushing harder,
                using more coffee, more alcohol, more willpower - just to maintain the appearance of having it all together.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                Restrictive diets that fail. Overtraining that leaves you exhausted. Using willpower to quit substances,
                only to cave under pressure. Winging it because no system seems to work for someone like you.

                Another year passes. Your health gets worse. Your relationships suffer. Your business plateaus

                who you could be becomes permanent.
