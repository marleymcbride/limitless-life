            Introduction
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            So let&apos;s get it in the open.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            You make good money, got the career, maybe even the nice house and family..
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            On the surface? Life ain&apos;t going too bad.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And look, you probably had this big grandiose vision of once you got here you&apos;d feel great..
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            The long nights, the stress, the years of grinding away would lift you to a state where you felt complete.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            But for some reason… <strong>you don&apos;t.</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            It&apos;s like after ticking off the financial / success box, it just doesn&apos;t feel like you thought it would.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And sure, the money can buy nicer things.. it puts you in a nicer house, nicer car, you can go to fancy restaurants and cool trips each year.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            But if you look at your ACTUAL happiness.. <strong>not that much has changed.</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Now if you&apos;re anything like me, you probably thought you&apos;d reach that day where all the stress and BS of work and life would just.. disappear.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            But here you were this morning, waking up feeling exhausted and stressed about the day ahead.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            You&apos;re 3 coffees down JUST to get yourself going.. (which you know is actually just making you more ratty and on-edge)
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And when you get home all you wanna do is grab the drink, slump on the couch and shut off from the world.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Wasn&apos;t you meant to get here and actually have time to enjoy life…
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            You know, to be able to look after your health and body?
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            To be that happy, full of life guy for your family and friends?
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            To feel stress-free and not be still carrying the burden of work every day?
          </p>

          <div className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-14 mt-8">
            But the stress never ends
          </div>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            I&apos;ll be man to man with you here..

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Life is damn stressful. I get it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And you probably feel like you can&apos;t talk about it.. you know, being this &apos;successful&apos; guy and whatnot.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            So.. you just suck it up.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            You put on a brave face and act like everything&apos;s sweet.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            But if you look in the mirror? You&apos;re not happy.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            You can see your face is tired and puffy.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Your gut starting to hang over your belt.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And you know you should lay off the booze… but then it&apos;s another stressful day and you&apos;re right back there at 5pm pouring a glass.
          </p>

          <div className="my-8"></div>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text font-bold">
            <strong>Because here&apos;s the reality…</strong>
          </p>

          <div className="my-8"></div>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            <strong>You&apos;re stuck in a low frequency.</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Now I&apos;m not one to get woo-woo or spiritual or anything… but it&apos;s clear to me there&apos;s people who have good vibes, and people who don&apos;t.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve seen some guys who just seem to &apos;have it&apos;.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            They&apos;re always happy, radiating this elite energy, it&apos;s almost infectious!
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And they&apos;re not more &apos;successful&apos; than you, make similar money, on paper have a similar life…
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            It&apos;s just an &apos;energy&apos;, and you can see they clearly look after their body.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And if you are where I was.. all you can think is &apos;I want THAT&apos;.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Now you might not know a guy like this, but for me that was always my north star.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            To not just be successful and have money… to be the whole package.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Strong body, peaceful mind, healthy and vibrant in all areas.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And when I thought about it, I dialled it down to 7 key areas:
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            But when you&apos;re so focussed on becoming successful.. it&apos;s all so easy to put your body and health on the back burner.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            You know, just until the business got to a good place.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And then ONE day.. when you get to this magical position of 0 stress and responsibilities…
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            THEN you&apos;ll get your dream body.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Then you&apos;ll work on becoming this confident, charismatic guy.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            But here&apos;s the thing:

          <div className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-14 mt-8">
            Energy = The Cornerstone of Your Business

            The person with the most energy wins.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text underline">
            <strong>Period.</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Imagine you had 3 extra hours of unrelenting energy every single day.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Think what you could actually do with that!
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Your business would probably be twice the size.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And when I started piecing this together, I realised energy is the real play.

          <div className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-14 mt-8">
            Because money is just a number

            Once you have enough, it doesn&apos;t really do any more for your life…
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            In fact it does just seem to bring more and more stress.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            I figured out the REAL thing I want is more energy…

            <strong>Energy is presence. Power. Aura.</strong>

            You&apos;ve probably been told this is just &quot;getting older.&quot;

            But if anything.. life as a man should get BETTER.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            You shouldn&apos;t have to drag yourself out of bed wondering if you&apos;ll even get through the day.

            You shouldn&apos;t NEED coffee after coffee just to think straight, or drinks every night to shut your brain off.

            Because 3 years ago I was there too.

            I had the masters degree, good job in the city, good social life.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            I was falling asleep at my desk at 10am. I was drinking almost every night. In honesty I could barely bring myself to get out of bed.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And my body was a shell of what it was.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            So I did what everyone says to do online:
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Train harder, eat less, just use willpower and stop drinking.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            But nothing worked.

            Until I got blackout drunk Halloween 2021.

            I woke up next morning with no wallet, and missed all my clients.

            But it hit me:

            Everything in my life was causing me to be stressed and anxious.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            And nothing would change unless I fixed what was actually broken inside.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            So I scrapped everything the fitness &apos;gurus&apos; said and fixed my body at the root causes.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            The Limitless Protocol was designed primarily for men living high-stress lives due to their business/work and family commitments. If you feel successful on paper, but you know in the health and physical side you&apos;re not satisfied.. then this will be perfect for you.

            <strong>Can I actually get results training only 2-3 days per week?</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            Yes. Because we focus on recovery. Your body builds muscle when it rests, not when you&apos;re slaving away 4, 5, 6 days a week. You will actually get BETTER results from 2-3 days, the secret is doing less.. but doing it better.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            The system is built for demanding schedules. ALL training can be done in 2 days per week. Calls are flexible and will be recorded. Time should be no issue.

            You can expect to see energy improvements in the first 2-4 weeks. For each area we work on it will depend on your lifestyle and how well you follow the plan, but body changes, release from alcohol etc is expected within the month or two.

            Because we fix what&apos;s broken instead of adding more stress. You&apos;ve been doing MORE - more training, more restriction, more willpower. This does LESS. We address root causes, not symptoms. But if you&apos;re using past failures as an excuse not to try, that&apos;s on you.

            <strong>Do I need to buy supplements?</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4 black-friday-body-text">
            It depends. Once we&apos;ve looked at your diet, situation, run tests I can get a better understanding of what is needed. But there is no supplement requirement. In fact, that&apos;s why I promote the Anti Stack™ :)

            This is designed specifically for busy men, often who will be in their 40s and 50s. But there is no age limit (ok maybe if you&apos;re 70 then don&apos;t join)... You will be surprised just how capable you are, and I have no doubt you can do this system.

            You maintain it yourself. That&apos;s the point. I&apos;m teaching your body to work properly, not building dependency on me. Most guys continue for another round because they want to keep going, but it&apos;s optional. You&apos;ll have the systems and knowledge to run it solo.

            Nope.. actually. If you don&apos;t do the work, you won&apos;t get the results. Simple. All I can do is lay out the plan and systems that have worked for myself and countless others. If you&apos;re looking for hand-holding and guarantees, it&apos;s maybe a sign you&apos;re looking for a get-out before you&apos;ve even started. Don&apos;t do the work, then I guarantee

            Don&apos;t worry, this is not a complicated system. In fact I&apos;ve made it as simple and easy as possible. I sometimes joke to people this is the &apos;Lazy Man&apos;s&apos; method to elite health lol.
            But if you don&apos;t trust yourself to just show up and take action, then you&apos;re probably not gonna be a fit. Please ONLY join if you are serious about getting LIFECHANGING results in the next 3-6 months.

            To make sure I can give you proper attention from me you deserve. Whilst in a cohort, I will still be working with you personally. And to do this, I&apos;m keeping things lean so spots WILL be limited.
