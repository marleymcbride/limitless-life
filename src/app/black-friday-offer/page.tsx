          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-8">
            You make good money, got the career, maybe even the family... and on the surface everything's rosy.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
            And look, you probably thought once you got here you'd feel like yourself.

          Alive, energized, like yourself again.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
            But for some reason… you don't.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
            Maybe you don't have that feeling inside you thought you would after ticking off the money and success box.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
            Maybe you wake up exhausted most days, and need coffee just to think straight.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
            Maybe by 2pm you're completely done, reading the same email three times trying to make sense of it.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
            And maybe when you get home you just wanna get a drink and collapse on the couch, and shut off from the world.

            The stress of doing what you do.

            You might feel like you can't talk about it... I know that's how I felt.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
            So? You just suck it up, put on a brave face and act like everything's kosher.

            But when you look in the mirror.. you barely recognize yourself.

            In your eyes alone. You don't feel close to being in your highest frequency.

            Yet that's what all this hustle and grind was meant to bring.. Right?!

            Once you have enough, it ain't really doing all that much more for your life.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-8">
            But energy is MORE than that.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-8">
            And here's what makes it Worse:
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
            You've probably seen someone who just has it. Not more successful than you. Probably makes similar money. But he's got something—this spark, this presence—that just works. People listen when he talks. He seems to have what you remember having but can't find anymore.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
            And you're thinking: what does he have that I don't?

            His body works. Yours doesn't. Not yet.

            Here's What Nobody Tells You: energy isn't just a health thing. It's a business thing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-4">
            The person with the most energy wins. Not the smartest. Not the most prepared. The highest energy.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-8">
            You've hit a ceiling you can't see. You're trying to perform at the next level with a body running at 60%. You literally cannot get there operating this way.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-8">
            The guys beating you aren't smarter. Their body works and yours doesn't. That's not a small edge. That's everything.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-8">
            2021, I was on 800mg caffeine a day. Anxious constantly. Drinking most nights just to turn my brain off. Felt like shit. Got my testosterone tested - 346. About 50% of where it should've been.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-8">
            Tried everything. Quit coffee - felt like death. Quit drinking - cracked by Friday. Trained harder - just got injured. Bought all the supplements - nothing.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-8">
            Because I was throwing random shit at the wall.

          <p className="text-gray-100 mb-8">
            But I figured out what was actually broken. Few months later, testosterone went 346 to 550. Off alcohol completely - 3 years now. Off caffeine - 18 months. More energy now than I had at 15.

          <p className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-14 mb-12">
            Wasn't willpower. Was fixing the systems.

            Since then I've helped dozens of guys do the same thing.

          <p>Client L - drinking heavily, looking rough. 15 months later - sober, 35 pounds lighter, crushing his career. Rob dropped 186 to 169. Laurence - 68kg to 62.5kg in 8 weeks, body fat 12-13% down to 9-10%.</p>

          <p>94% stay caffeine-free. 89% stay alcohol-free. Average testosterone increase - 320 points. Average fat loss - 18-24 pounds over 90 days.</p>
