Introduction
[SPACING: LARGE]

So let’s get it in the open.

You make good money, got the career, maybe even the nice house and family..

On the surface? Life ain’t going too bad.

And look, you probably had this big grandiose vision of once you got here you’d feel great..

The long nights, the stress, the years of grinding away would lift you to a state where you felt complete.

But for some reason… **you don’t.**

It’s like after ticking off the financial / success box, it just doesn’t feel like you thought it would.

And sure, the money can buy nicer things.. it puts you in a nicer house, nicer car, you can go to fancy restaurants and cool trips each year.

But if you look at your ACTUAL happiness.. **not that much has changed.**

Now if you’re anything like me, you probably thought you’d reach that day where all the stress and BS of work and life would just.. disappear.

But here you were this morning, waking up feeling exhausted and stressed about the day ahead.

You’re 3 coffees down JUST to get yourself going.. (which you know is actually just making you more ratty and on-edge)

And when you get home all you wanna do is grab the drink, slump on the couch and shut off from the world.

[SPACING: LARGE]
**If this sounds about right, let me ask you this:**
[SPACING: LARGE]

Wasn’t you meant to get here and actually have time to enjoy life…

You know, to be able to look after your health and body?

To be that happy, full of life guy for your family and friends?

To feel stress-free and not be still carrying the burden of work every day?

[SPACING: LARGE]
[ALIGN: CENTER]
[STYLE: H2_CENTER_BOLD]
But the stress never ends
[ALIGN: LEFT]
[SPACING: LARGE]

I’ll be man to man with you here..

Life is damn stressful. I get it.

And you probably feel like you can’t talk about it.. you know, being this ‘succesful’ guy and whatnot.

So.. you just suck it up.

You put on a brave face and act like everything’s sweet.

But if you look in the mirror? You’re not happy.

You can see your face is tired and puffy.

Your gut starting to hang over your belt.

And you know you should lay off the booze… but then it’s another stressful day and you’re right back there at 5pm pouring a glass.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Because here’s the reality…
[SPACING: LARGE]

**You’re stuck in a low frequency.**

Now I’m not one to get woo-woo or spiritual or anything… but it’s clear to me there’s people who have good vibes, and people who don’t.

I’m sure you’ve seen some guys who just seem to ‘have it’.

They’re always happy, radiating this elite energy, it’s almost infectious!

And they’re not more ‘successful’ than you, make similar money, on paper have a similar life…

It’s just an ‘energy’, and you can see they clearly look after their body.

And if you are where I was.. all you can think is ‘I want THAT’.

Now you might not know a guy like this, but for me that was always my north star.

To not just be successful and have money… to be the whole package.

Strong body, peaceful mind, healthy and vibrant in all areas.

And when I thought about it, I dialled it down to 7 key areas:

But when you’re so focussed on becoming successful.. it’s all so easy to put your body and health on the back burner.

You know, just until the business got to a good place.

And then ONE day.. when you get to this magical position of 0 stress and responsibilities…

THEN you’ll get your dream body.

Then you’ll work on becoming this confident, charismatic guy.

But here’s the thing:

[SPACING: LARGE]
[ALIGN: CENTER]
[STYLE: H2_CENTER_BOLD]
Energy = The Cornerstone of Your Business.
[ALIGN: LEFT]
[SPACING: LARGE]

The person with the most energy wins.

**[STYLE: UNDERLINE]Period.**

Imagine you had 3 extra hours of unrelenting energy every single day.

Think what you could actually do with that!

Your business would probably be twice the size.

And when I started piecing this together, I realised energy is the real play.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[ALIGN: CENTER]
[STYLE: H2_CENTER_BOLD]
Because money is just a number.
[ALIGN: LEFT]
[SPACING: LARGE]

Once you have enough, it doesn’t really do any more for your life…

In fact it does just seem to bring more and more stress.

I figured out the REAL thing I want is more energy…

**Energy is presence. Power. Aura.**

All the things you associate when you think of a ‘complete man’.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
But here’s the problem…
[SPACING: LARGE]

**The modern world has destroyed the modern man**

You've probably been told this is just "getting older."

That “life’s downhill after 30”.

But if anything.. life as a man should get BETTER.

You shouldn’t have to drag yourself out of bed wondering if you’ll even get through the day.

You shouldn’t be ashamed to take your shirt off.

You shouldn’t NEED coffee after coffee just to think straight, or drinks every night to shut your brain off.

But the truth is…

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Male Testosterone Has Dropped 25% Since 2007
[SPACING: LARGE]

A 40-year-old man today has the SAME testosterone as an 80-year-old from 50 years ago.

Men with declining testosterone have up to 50% higher chance of early death.

And the more successful you get, the less people care about how you actually feel.

But you don’t have the privilege to neglect your health and energy anymore.

Because without energy, you have **NOTHING**.

Without energy, your relationships suffer, your work drops, your body deteriorates.

And you will KEEP on waking up feeling like this, until you change your system.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[ALIGN: CENTER]
[STYLE: H2_CENTER_BOLD]
How Do I Know?
[ALIGN: LEFT]
[SPACING: LARGE]

Because 3 years ago I was there too.

I had the masters degree, good job in the city, good social life.

But in reality?

I was falling asleep at my desk at 10am. I was drinking almost every night. In honesty I could barely bring myself to get out of bed.

And my body was a shell of what it was.

So I did what everyone says to do online:

Train harder, eat less, just use willpower and stop drinking.

But nothing worked.

Until I got blackout drunk Halloween 2021.

I woke up next morning with no wallet, and missed all my clients.

But it hit me:

Everything in my life was causing me to be stressed and anxious.

And nothing would change unless I fixed what was actually broken inside.

So I scrapped everything the fitness ‘gurus’ said and fixed my body at the root causes.

[SPACING: LARGE]

[STYLE: H2_CENTER_BOLD]
Why Everything You’ve Tried Has Failed
[ALIGN: LEFT]
[SPACING: LARGE]

You've been told you need to:

1. **Cut calories, skip meals, and restrict your food intake.**
2. **Train 4, 5, 6 days a week and push yourself harder in the gym.**
3. **Use discipline + willpower to control your drinking and lifestyle habits.**
4. **Take a load of supplements and track every part of your life.**

But these outdated, inefficient methods **[STYLE: UNDERLINE]DO NOT work…**

Because they don’t address the root causes of what’s actually fucked.

(I’ll preface if you don’t like me swearing we’re probably not gonna get on… so you might as well fuck off now.)

**Staying? Fucking right.**

After 3 years I found a MUCH simpler way to live…

Introducing: The Limitless Protocol™
[ALIGN: LEFT]
[SPACING: LARGE]

This is a never-seen system.. designed to completely re-align your body, health and energy.

It’s NOT Keto, carnivore or having to cut out any of your favorite foods.

It’s NOT a strict, obsessive regiment that takes over your lifestyle.

In fact, it doesn’t take more than 2 days of training per WEEK.

Because here’s the problem:

Most approaches just try to do more.

More training. More supplements. More willpower. More misery.

I created a unique system that requires you to do 1 thing differently:

**Less.**

So let me first show you if this system is right for you:

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Who this is for:
[SPACING: LARGE]

This is for you if:
*   You wake up exhausted every morning
*   No matter how much you train your gut just won’t budge
*   You need multiple coffees to function and 2-3 drinks to wind down
*   You have no energy left for people who matter most

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Who this is NOT for:
[SPACING: LARGE]

*   You’re looking for a quick fix or magic pill
*   You give up easily and can’t stick to anything for longer than 2 weeks
*   You need someone to hold your hand every day
*   You’re not willing to change the way you’ve done things for years

[SPACING: LARGE]
[ALIGN: CENTER]
[STYLE: H2_CENTER_BOLD]
How to Get Your Energy, Aura, & Masculine Presence Back
[STYLE: H3_CENTER_BOLD]
(without burning out, giving up your favorite foods or over-training):
[ALIGN: LEFT]
[SPACING: LARGE]

[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Step 1: The Limitless Morning
[SPACING: LARGE]

You’ve been starting your days wrong for years.. leaving you feeling tired, stressed and anxious before you even leave the house.
We use **The Anti-Stack™** system to kickstart your mornings and rewire your natural energy.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Step 2: Rest-Focused Training
[SPACING: LARGE]

They’ve told you you need to train 4+ days a week to get in shape. But doing that does not focus on where the gains are made: at rest.
We instead train just 2-3 days per week, and use the **Power Presence Method™** to build the muscles that build your masculine aura and presence.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Step 3: Limitless Flow™
[SPACING: LARGE]

This is where you see everything come together. Instead of designing a fitness regime, we design a **LIFESTYLE**.

We set up your day so everything works smoothly - you reduce your stress to a minimum, become more present and confident without needing alcohol, and radiate REAL energy without endless coffees to get through the day.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Step 4: The Health Reset™
[SPACING: LARGE]

Years of throwing money at random diets and supplements is out. The **Bottleneck Test™** finds the biggest constraints of what’s happening inside.
We then use **Metabolic Priming™** and the **Hormone Reset™** to help your body start working like it should again.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[ALIGN: CENTER]
[STYLE: H2_CENTER_BOLD]
The Timeline
[ALIGN: LEFT]
[SPACING: LARGE]

[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Phase 1: The Foundations (Week 1-6)
[SPACING: LARGE]

First thing we’ll do is get crystal clear on your gameplan. Every situation, life, and journey to becoming Limitless is different.
That’s why we run you through The Bottleneck Test, then craft your Limitless Gameplan of:
*   Your **Rest-Focused Training™ Plan**: We craft your elite body in just 2-3 days of training using the **Power Presence Method™** to build muscle that creates masculine presence and aura
*   Your **Metabolic Priming™ System**: we use strategic nutrition to kickstart your metabolism so you can start eating more whilst burning fat simultaneously
*   Your **First Visible Shifts**: you’ll notice your gut flattening, face leaning out, sleep improving, and your body finally responding to training because it’s finally getting the recovery it needs.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Phase 2: Oscillating (Week 7-11)
[SPACING: LARGE]

With the foundations in place, we put our focus towards your lifestyle, We set a foundation for all the inner patterns keeping you stuck in a low frequency.
We bring in **The Limitless Morning**, and your natural flow system - helping you feel more relaxed. By now you’ll notice your natural energy rising consistently, visible muscle across your body taking place and booze starting to lose it’s grip.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Phase 3: Limitless (Week 12-17)
[SPACING: LARGE]

Now it’s time to **Become Limitless**. We go deep in to your health, running high level blood tests with **The Hormone Reset**, studying the data, and bringing in **The Anti Stack** to delete your caffeine and supplement needs.

You’ll start waking up every day with that infectious energy, Notice you’re now hitting 20+ lbs of fat lost, and your testosterone increasing. Morning wood back, brain fog disappeared, your gut healed, all that good stuff.

And by Month 4 you reach **The Natty Sweet Spot™** - where your body, hormones, health, peace, energy and presence all align. Limitless.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[ALIGN: CENTER]
[STYLE: H2_CENTER_BOLD]
In a Nutshell:
[ALIGN: LEFT]
[SPACING: LARGE]

*   **Phase 1**: Build your elite body training just 2-3 days per week and start seeing visible changes whilst still eating pizzas.
*   **Phase 2**: See your natural energy come in, your masculine presence becoming eye-catching, whilst the grab to alcohol feels much smaller.
*   **Phase 3**: Wake up every day with at least 3 hours of pure unrelenting energy, and become the complete man with the aura and happiness you deserve.

FAQ
[ALIGN: LEFT]
[SPACING: LARGE]

[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Who is Limitless for?
[SPACING: LARGE]

The Limitless Protocol was designed primarily for men living high-stress lives due to their business/work and family commitments. If you feel successful on paper, but you know in the health and physical side you’re not satisfied.. then this will be perfect for you.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Can I actually get results training only 2-3 days per week?
[SPACING: LARGE]

Yes. Because we focus on recovery. Your body builds muscle when it rests, not when you’re slaving away 4, 5, 6 days a week. You will actually get BETTER results from 2-3 days, the secret is doing less.. but doing it better.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Will I have time for this
[SPACING: LARGE]

The system is built for demanding schedules. ALL training can be done in 2 days per week. Calls are flexible and will be recorded. Time should be no issue.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
How long until I see results?
[SPACING: LARGE]

You can expect to see energy improvements in the first 2-4 weeks. For each area we work on it will depend on your lifestyle and how well you follow the plan, but body changes, release from alcohol etc is expected within the month or two.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
I’ve tried everything before. Will this work?
[SPACING: LARGE]

Because we fix what's broken instead of adding more stress. You've been doing MORE - more training, more restriction, more willpower. This does LESS. We address root causes, not symptoms. But if you’re using past failures as an excuse not to try, that's on you.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Do I need to buy supplements?
[SPACING: LARGE]

It depends. Once we’ve looked at your diet, situation, run tests I can get a better understanding of what is needed. But there is no supplement requirement. In fact, that’s why I promote the Anti Stack™ :)

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Am I too old / too far gone for this?
[SPACING: LARGE]

This is designed specifically for busy men, often who will be in their 40s and 50s. But there is no age limit (ok maybe if you’re 70 then don’t join)... You will be surprised just how capable you are, and I have no doubt you can do this system.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
What happens after 17 weeks?
[SPACING: LARGE]

You maintain it yourself. That's the point. I’m teaching your body to work properly, not building dependency on me. Most guys continue for another round because they want to keep going, but it's optional. You'll have the systems and knowledge to run it solo.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Is there a refund policy?
[SPACING: LARGE]

Nope.. actually. If you don’t do the work, you won’t get the results. Simple. All I can do is lay out the plan and systems that have worked for myself and countless others. If you’re looking for hand-holding and guarantees, it’s maybe a sign you’re looking for a get-out before you’ve even started. Don’t do the work, then I guarantee

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
What if I can’t stick to it?
[SPACING: LARGE]

Don’t worry, this is not a complicated system. In fact I’ve made it as simple and easy as possible. I sometimes joke to people this is the ‘Lazy Man’s’ method to elite health lol.
But if you don’t trust yourself to just show up and take action, then you’re probably not gonna be a fit. Please ONLY join if you are serious about getting LIFECHANGING results in the next 3-6 months.

[SPACING: LARGE]
[STYLE: H3_LEFT_BOLD]
Why only 10 spots?
[SPACING: LARGE]

To make sure I can give you proper attention from me you deserve. Whilst in a cohort, I will still be working with you personally. And to do this, I’m keeping things lean so spots WILL be limited.
